## üß† Key Design Principles

| Principle             | Implementation Example                                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Encapsulation         | `Basket` class handles pricing logic internally                 |
| Dependency Injection  | `Basket` accepts catalog, delivery_rule, and offers as injected dependencies |
| Strategy Pattern      | Delivery and Offer behaviors can be swapped dynamically         |
| Open/Closed Principle | Easily add new offers or delivery rules without changing existing code |
| Single Responsibility | Each class has one job: pricing, product lookup, or rule evaluation |
